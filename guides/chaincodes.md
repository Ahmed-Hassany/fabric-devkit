# Chaincodes

This lab contains a series of small (i.e. very minimum functionality) chaincodes intended primarily to help bootstrap the reference networks in this DevKit.

If you wish to learn to write chaincodes, please refer to:

* [Writing Go chaincode](https://github.com/workingwithblockchain/writing-go-chaincodes)
* Writing chaincode in other languages -- under development.

## Content

The lab is located [here](../chaincodes/).

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minimalcc` | This is a simple chaincode illustrating the transfer to some numeric value between two parties. |
| `one` | This is a chaincode intended to be used in conjuction with `solo network` reference implementation. |
| `two` | This is a chaincode intended to be used in conjunction with `solo network` reference implementation. |

## Important note

This lab space is not intended as a repository for you to create and store chaincode for your project. You should create it as a separate code repo in Github, Bitbucket, etc.

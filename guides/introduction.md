# How to use Aladdin's Fabric Developers' Kit

Aladdin's Fabric Developers' Kit (or Fabric Devkit) is a toolbox to help developer create Fabric apps and platform engineers to appreciate the process involved in spinning up a working Fabric network. 

For the purpose of this user guide, we shall use the term 'developer' as a catch-all term to refer to application developers and platform engineers.

> Note:
> 1. The toolkit uses out-of-the-box open source Fabric components to help developers spin-up a working Fabric networks and create apps. It does not imply that the examples presented in this kit necessarily represents production ready use cases. These are intended only to present concepts.
> 2. Hyperledger Fabric is an evolving blockchain platform. This DevKit does not necessary represents all aspects of Fabric. However, it represents components that are sufficient to spin-up a working network.

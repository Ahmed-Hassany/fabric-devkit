# Aladdin Fabric Development Kit

[Aladdin Blockchain Technologies Ltd](https://aladdinid.com/) sponsored the creation of the Fabric development kit, which was codename `Maejor`. The kit was developed by [Elemental Concept](http://elementalconcept.com/) who then use it to build a Fabric based [Proof-of-Concept (PoC) medical audit trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJmhwymh-eU). 

Following from the PoC, Aladdin has kindly open source the developer kit and make it available to the wider Blockchain developers' community to add more features.

The maintainer(s) of this project is grateful to Aladdin for sponsoring the effort to create the kit and donating the code to this community.

## Design goals

The design goals of the kit are to help developers:

* learn, through a series of smoke tests, the system architecture of Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric);
* define, instantiate and configure a Fabric network to support development effort;
* verify that apps developed to interact with the Fabric network meets expectation.

The development kit has three components:

* Example Go chaincodes
* Reference implementations
* Command line interface (CLI) known as `maejor`

## Release notes

### v0.1

Features:

* Implementation named `twoorgs`.
* Network components based on Fabric 1.1.0 containers and docker compose
* Bash based scripts to support kit orchestration - i.e. macOS and Ubuntu based

Status: 

* Released
* No further update

### v0.2

Features:

* Add a new reference implementation named `multichain`
* `meajor` - generating a skeleton Fabric network specifications

Status:

* Under development.

## Content

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `chaincodes` | Example Go chaincodes |
| `guides` | How-to documentation |
| `maejor` | Source codes for `maejor` application |
| `reference` | A collection of smoke testing implementation of a fabric network setup |

### Chaincodes

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minimalcc` | This is a simple chaincode illustrating the transfer to some numeric value between two parties. |
| `one` | This is a chaincode intended to be used in conjuction with `multichain` reference implementation. |
| `two` | This is a chaincode intended to be used in conjunction with `multichain` reference implementation. |

### Guides

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `two-orgs.md` | User and contextual guide for the reference/twoorgs implementation |

### Maejor cli application

Please refer to [README](./maejor/README.md) for implementation information.

### Reference

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `multichain` | This is an example of an implementation involving two organisational nodes with two channels. It also based on the very latest Fabric implementation. |
| `twoorgs` | This is a full end-to-end example based on two organisational nodes, one channel, Fabric Node SDK, Hyperledger Explorer and Fabric 1.1.0. |

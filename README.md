# Introduction

The artefacts, or Fabric development kit, found in this Git repo is intended to help developers:

* learn what is involved in orchestrating and instantiating a Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric) network;
* debug chaincode.

# Features

**Current version**: 1.0.1-alpha

## Version: 1.0

1. A simple end-to-end command line (CLI) solution based on a fixed two-organisations Fabric network.
2. Verified for used on macOS and Linux only
3. Compatible with Docker engine 18.06.0-ce and Docker compose 1.22.0

## Version: 1.0.1-alpha

1. Features from v1.0
2. Hyperledger Blockchain Explorer integrated. This is based on Explorer version 0.3.1 AS-IS.
3. This is only a alpha primarily for preview purposes only.

## For future considerations

1. Feature to enable developer customise a locally instantiable Fabric network to minic a production version for testing.
2. Feature to enable developer deploy a development only Fabric network in a shared platform (i.e. cloud, etc.) to enable multiple developers to collaborate.

# Pre-requisites

1. Install [Go](http://golang.org/dl).

    * for macOS, we recommend installing via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/);

    * for other platforms please refer to [installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Set the environmental variable GOPATH to a reference a directory to host your Go source codes and binaries (i.e. Go workspace). For example,

    `export GOPATH=$HOME/go-projects`

3. Create a folder in `$GOPATH/src` and navigate to it. Under the folder clone this repository.

# Content

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| chaincodes/ | This folder contains chaincodes |
| chaincodes/minimalcc | This folder is the container for a default version of a chaincode for illustration purposes only |
| consortium | This folder contains definitions of and scripts to orchestrate Fabric network |
| consortium/twoorgs | This is a default two organisations fabric network intended for illustration purposes only |

# Two-organisations consortium

This configuration of Fabric network provides developers with the opportunity to quickly debug a chaincode. A default two-organisations network is provided where developers could subject their chaincode to interaction between two organisations.

Please refer to [this for a detail description](./docs/two-orgs.md)
